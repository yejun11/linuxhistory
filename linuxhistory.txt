LINUX began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds:
to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting LINUX kernel has
been marked by constant growth throughout s history. Since the inial release of s sorce code in 1991,  has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibing commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 wh more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the CNU General Public License v2

After AT&T ha dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Rchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first relased in 1970. Later they rewrote  in a new programming language, C, to make  portable. The availabily and protabily of Unix caused  to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic instutions and businesses
